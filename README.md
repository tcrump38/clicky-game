# clicky-game

The Clicky Memory Game is a guessing game made with React, ES6 and Bootstrap.

Our app keeps track of correct guesses and restarts on false guesses. A user cannot repeat a selection.

Cards are generated randomly with each selection.

Clicky Game is deployed on github: https://tcrump38.github.io/clicky-game/
